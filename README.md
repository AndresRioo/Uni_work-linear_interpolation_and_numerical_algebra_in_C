# Uni_work-linear_interpolation_and_numerical_algebra_in_C
This project implements fundamental scientific computing methods using the C programming language. It focuses on two main areas:  Linear interpolation to approximate functions based on discrete data points and Numerical linear algebra, including solving systems of linear equations using techniques such as Gaussian elimination.
